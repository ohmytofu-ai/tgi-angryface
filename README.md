## Motivation
This repo aims to make the ü§ó Text Generation Inference more awesome by focussing on real world deployment scenarios that are not purely focussed on a 350M$ funded ecosystem.

TGI is well suited for distributed/ cloud burst/ on-demand workloads, yet HF's focus seems to be (enterprisy) long-running single model endpoints. We are aiming to change that.

## Goals
- ‚òëÔ∏è loads LLama2 in 4bit on a Pascal GPU (1080, Llama 2 7B)
- Support Model loading from wherever you want (HDFS, S3, HTTPS, ‚Ä¶)
- ‚òëÔ∏è Support Adapters (LORA/PEFT) without merging (possibly huge) Checkpoints and uploading them to ü§ó
- Support last Gen GPUS (back to Pascal hopefully)
- Reduce operational cost by making TGI-üòë an disposable, hot swapable workhorse
- running a cluste of TGI nodes (via ray?)
- Get back to a truyl open source license
- Support more core frameworks than HF products

# ü¶ô LLama 2 in 4bit

To use Llama 2 7B on a 1080 (Pascal Gen, Compute capability 6.1):
1) Install this repository via `make install`
2) Install each the latest transformers, bitsandbytes, accelerate via `pip3 install git+https://repo/project`
3) Modify `server/Makefile` section `run-dev` and change the `/mnt/TOFU/HF_MODELS/` path to a path where you have downloaded a HF model via `git lfs clone https://huggingface.co/[repo]/[model]`. E.g. the model will be loaded as `/data/models/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf`
4) open two terminals
5) terminal 1: `make router-dev` (starts the router that exposes the model at localhost:8080)
6) terminal 2: `make server-dev` (starts the model server, loads the model to the GPU)
7) test the model by calling it with CURL `curl localhost:8080/generate     -X POST     -d '{"inputs":"What is Deep Learning?","parameters":{"max_new_tokens":90}}'     -H 'Content-Type: application/json'`


## LLama with PEFT
### Production
to compile run `make install-launcher`
run the `text-generation-launcher --model-id meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf --port 8080 --quantize bitsandbytes --peft-model-path /my-models/my-peft`
The `--peft-model-path` folder should contain a `adater_config.json` file.

### Development
append `--peft-model-path /my/local/peft-adapter-folder` to  the `run-dev` command inside `server/Makefile` and follow the steps indicated inside the prev. section. The folder should contain a `adater_config.json` file.

## Get started

### Docker

The easiest way of getting started is using the official Docker container:

```shell
model=tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct
volume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run

docker run --gpus all --shm-size 1g -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:1.0.2 --model-id $model
```
**Note:** To use GPUs, you need to install the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html). We also recommend using NVIDIA drivers with CUDA version 11.8 or higher. For running the Docker container on a machine with no GPUs or CUDA support, it is enough to remove the `--gpus all` flag and add `--disable-custom-kernels`, please note CPU is not the intended platform for this project, so performance might be subpar.

To see all options to serve your models (in the [code](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference/blob/main/launcher/src/main.rs) or in the cli):
```
text-generation-launcher --help
```

You can then query the model using either the `/generate` or `/generate_stream` routes:

```shell
curl 127.0.0.1:8080/generate \
    -X POST \
    -d '{"inputs":"What is Deep Learning?","parameters":{"max_new_tokens":20}}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

```shell
curl 127.0.0.1:8080/generate_stream \
    -X POST \
    -d '{"inputs":"What is Deep Learning?","parameters":{"max_new_tokens":20}}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

or from Python:

```shell
pip install text-generation
```

```python
from text_generation import Client

client = Client("http://127.0.0.1:8080")
print(client.generate("What is Deep Learning?", max_new_tokens=20).generated_text)

text = ""
for response in client.generate_stream("What is Deep Learning?", max_new_tokens=20):
    if not response.token.special:
        text += response.token.text
print(text)
```

### API documentation

You can consult the OpenAPI documentation of the `text-generation-inference` REST API using the `/docs` route.
The Swagger UI is also available at: [https://huggingface.github.io/text-generation-inference](https://huggingface.github.io/text-generation-inference).

### Using a private or gated model

You have the option to utilize the `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` environment variable for configuring the token employed by
`text-generation-inference`. This allows you to gain access to protected resources.

For example, if you want to serve the gated Llama V2 model variants:

1. Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
2. Copy your cli READ token
3. Export `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=<your cli READ token>`

or with Docker:

```shell
model=meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf
volume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run
token=<your cli READ token>

docker run --gpus all --shm-size 1g -e HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=$token -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:1.0.2 --model-id $model
```

### A note on Shared Memory (shm)

[`NCCL`](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/index.html) is a communication framework used by
`PyTorch` to do distributed training/inference. `text-generation-inference` make
use of `NCCL` to enable Tensor Parallelism to dramatically speed up inference for large language models.

In order to share data between the different devices of a `NCCL` group, `NCCL` might fall back to using the host memory if
peer-to-peer using NVLink or PCI is not possible.

To allow the container to use 1G of Shared Memory and support SHM sharing, we add `--shm-size 1g` on the above command.

If you are running `text-generation-inference` inside `Kubernetes`. You can also add Shared Memory to the container by
creating a volume with:

```yaml
- name: shm
  emptyDir:
   medium: Memory
   sizeLimit: 1Gi
```

and mounting it to `/dev/shm`.

Finally, you can also disable SHM sharing by using the `NCCL_SHM_DISABLE=1` environment variable. However, note that
this will impact performance.

### Distributed Tracing

`text-generation-inference` is instrumented with distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry. You can use this feature
by setting the address to an OTLP collector with the `--otlp-endpoint` argument.

### Local install

You can also opt to install `text-generation-inference` locally.

First [install Rust](https://rustup.rs/) and create a Python virtual environment with at least
Python 3.9, e.g. using `conda`:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

conda create -n text-generation-inference python=3.9
conda activate text-generation-inference
```

You may also need to install Protoc.

On Linux:

```shell
PROTOC_ZIP=protoc-21.12-linux-x86_64.zip
curl -OL https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v21.12/$PROTOC_ZIP
sudo unzip -o $PROTOC_ZIP -d /usr/local bin/protoc
sudo unzip -o $PROTOC_ZIP -d /usr/local 'include/*'
rm -f $PROTOC_ZIP
```

On MacOS, using Homebrew:

```shell
brew install protobuf
```

Then run:

```shell
BUILD_EXTENSIONS=True make install # Install repository and HF/transformer fork with CUDA kernels
make run-falcon-7b-instruct
```

**Note:** on some machines, you may also need the OpenSSL libraries and gcc. On Linux machines, run:

```shell
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev gcc -y
```

### CUDA Kernels

The custom CUDA kernels are only tested on NVIDIA A100s. If you have any installation or runtime issues, you can remove
the kernels by using the `DISABLE_CUSTOM_KERNELS=True` environment variable.

Be aware that the official Docker image has them enabled by default.

## Run Falcon

### Run

```shell
make run-falcon-7b-instruct
```

### Quantization

You can also quantize the weights with bitsandbytes to reduce the VRAM requirement:

```shell
make run-falcon-7b-instruct-quantize
```

4bit quantization is available using the [NF4 and FP4 data types from bitsandbytes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14314.pdf). It can be enabled by providing `--quantize bitsandbytes-nf4` or `--quantize bitsandbytes-fp4` as a command line argument to `text-generation-launcher`.

## Develop

```shell
make server-dev
make router-dev
```

## Testing

```shell
# python
make python-server-tests
make python-client-tests
# or both server and client tests
make python-tests
# rust cargo tests
make rust-tests
# integration tests
make integration-tests
```

TGI is also supported on the following AI hardware accelerators:
